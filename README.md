# DE-projects
Here you can find my ideas and technical portfolio of Data Engineering projects.

And here is one curious link: https://blog.det.life/no-one-cares-about-your-data-engineering-project-def99d43c390

"We build projects to learn and gain exposure to new technology and methodology. This is the benefit. The artifacts we create are not the goal. The journey is the goal. Projects give us difficult problems to solve. The steps we take to solve those problems build on each other, creating a learning journey that generally goes well beyond our intended destination. We are simulating real-world experience in our own free time."
