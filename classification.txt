How I'm going to pick the projects:
1. Select scale (Company / Industry / Country / Region / Global).
2. Select the framework to identify the influencing factors (e.g. PESTLE).
3. Select challenges and level of detail.
4. Select way to solve ONE challenge and depth of solution.
5. Provide a specified, well-described technical solution.
6. Conclusions, i.e. could you apply your solution to another problem/situation/company? What were your difficulties and insights? 
   Compare with previous experience, summarise, define best practice.

And the first thing to remember!
The success of any commercial business depends on its ability to generate profits by delivering value to its customers. 
Reducing costs and increasing revenue are two key levers that organisations can use to improve profitability. 
Evaluating data-related tasks in the context of cost reduction, revenue growth and customer satisfaction helps to prioritise initiatives that will have the greatest impact on the bottom line.
