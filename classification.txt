How ow I'm going to pick the projects:
1. Select scale (Company / Industry / Country / Region / Global).
2. Select the framework to identify the influencing factors (e.g. PESTLE).
3. Select challenges and level of detail.
4. Select way to solve ONE challenge and depth of solution.
5. Provide a specified, well-described technical solution.

   Compare with previous experience, summarise, define best practice.
