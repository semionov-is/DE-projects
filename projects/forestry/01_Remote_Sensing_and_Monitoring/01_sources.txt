I'll try to find and/or emulate data from these types of related data sources:
1. Satellite Imagery - real
2. Weather Data - real
3. Soil data - real
4. LiDAR data - real
5. Forest Inventory Database - probably I will make one
6. Ground-Based Sensor Network - soil and maybe meteo, emulated
7. Audio/Video streams - some records of various sounds and short video of animals and people
8. Field collected data - real, some pictures and videos
