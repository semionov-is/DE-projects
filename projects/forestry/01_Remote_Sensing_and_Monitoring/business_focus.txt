Business-owner point of view:
Here are some key business tasks to solve using remote sensing and monitoring:

+ Forest Inventory and Mapping
	Utilize satellite imagery, aerial photography, and LiDAR data to create detailed maps of the forest stands.
	Develop algorithms to accurately classify different tree species, estimate tree heights, and calculate biomass.
	Integrate this spatial data with an existing forest inventory records for a comprehensive overview of the resources.

+ Forest Health Monitoring
	Implement techniques to detect and monitor pest infestations, disease outbreaks, and other biotic disturbances using multispectral and hyperspectral imagery.
	Develop early warning systems to alert us of potential threats, enabling timely interventions.
	Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends that could help us predict and mitigate future risks.

+ Sustainable Forest Management
	Integrate remote sensing data with an existing forest management plans to optimize harvest schedules, reforestation efforts, and other silvicultural practices.
	Develop algorithms to detect illegal logging activities and encroachments within the forest holdings.
	Explore the use of drone technology for precision forestry applications, such as targeted fertilization and pest control.

+ Climate Change Impact Assessment
	Utilize remote sensing data to monitor changes in forest productivity, phenology, and species distribution in response to climate change.
	Develop models to predict the potential impacts of climate change on the forests under different scenarios.
	Identify areas of high vulnerability and prioritize adaptive management strategies accordingly.

+ Data Integration and Visualization
	Develop a robust data management system to integrate and analyze data from various sources, including remote sensing, field measurements, and historical records.
	Create interactive dashboards and visualization tools to present complex data in a clear and actionable manner.
	Collaborate with the forestry experts to ensure that the tools and outputs are user-friendly and aligned with their needs.
